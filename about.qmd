## Introduction

Hello, welcome to my website! My name is Joseph Davis and I am a data scientist. I have always had a passion for learning and love solving complicated problems. Being a data scientist allows me to consistently grow as a person and be challenged everyday. In this website you have the opportunity to learn more about me as well as see some personal projects I have been worked on.

## Education

I completed my M.S degree in statistics at Miami  University of Ohio and my B.S in economics from OSU. From there I have worked on a variety of projects from creating databases and data pipelines, creating software applications with interactive analytics and visuals, to making models and forecasting. 

## Hobbies

Outside of being a data scientist I love spending my time with family, friends, and seeing the world. My favorite hobbies include snowboarding, rock climbing, biking, board games and reading.

## Awards

While at American Electric Power I received the ROI Rockstar award from SAS for their customer recognition awards. This was due to the financial engineering of in house software for interest rate derivatives based upon the new SOFR rate.
